Hi, I'm Cris Lourenz Tan, a 23-year-old based in Australia. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology with a major in Cyber Security. My passion for technology and fascination with securing digital landscapes led me to specialize in this field. I enjoy delving into the complexities of network security and staying up-to-date with the latest cyber threats. When I'm not immersed in the world of cybersecurity, you can find me exploring the beautiful landscapes of Australia or experimenting with new coding projects.
