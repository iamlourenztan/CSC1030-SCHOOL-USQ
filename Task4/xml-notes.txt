The XML structure was designed to efficiently organize Matilda Ann Emma Kerr's biography. Matilda's name is subdivided into first, middle, and last names for structured representation. Additionally, her birthdate and current age are captured using dedicated elements. Matilda's marital history is encapsulated within a <marriages> element, with each marriage described under a <marriage> element, including spouse details, start and end dates, and child count. The number of children for each marriage is denoted by the <children> element. For Matilda's child, Joshua, a separate <child> element is used to specify his name and birthdate. The information about Matilda's football matches is grouped under <footballMatches>, with individual matches detailed using <match> elements, including opponent, result, location, and supporter count. The XML file's well-formedness is ensured by adhering to XML syntax and structure rules, further validated using an XML editor. These choices were made to provide a clear and structured representation of the information presented in the biography.
